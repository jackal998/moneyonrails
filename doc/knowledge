### Ubuntu

1. ubuntu user name is some thing like this NAME_REGEX="^[a-z][-a-z0-9_]*$" and things like RAILS(uppercase) is not allowed

#### wsl

1. the fisrst time i do rails new myapp and some Operation not permitted failed occurrd, the solution can be things like this 
`sudo umount /mnt/c sudo mount -t drvfs C: /mnt/c -o metadata`
and make sure to delete files from incomplete rails new command first

2. for fatal:LF would be replaced by CRLF issue, i force my files to windows(CRLF) by sublime text 

{ "default_line_ending": "windows" } since i'm using windows.
`git config --global core.safecrlf true`
`git config --global core.autocrlf true`

### PG under windows

1. I chose C rather than [Default locale] on postgresql installation. like the step 7. in this article 
https://blog.csdn.net/u012325865/article/details/81951916

2. to use postgresql, make sure your username setting like premission / cluster setting, 
make sure your postgresql is running before trying to connect from rails. 
like the step 1.6 in this article (my host name is localhost and the article is localhost_presql)
https://blog.csdn.net/hadues/article/details/103757594

3. To connect postgresql with localhost, try to new a user from pgAdmin 4 rather than from ubuntu command line, 
not sure what's wrong with my setup but i found those users created from command line are somehow not sync or show in pgAdmin.

4. if username permission things bother you a lot, try to ALTER ROLE as superuser or simply use username: postgres password: postgres.

5. My rails app can't connect to my postgres server as first before i add "host: localhost" in database.yml

6. for pg dump/restore use the follows:
Method 1.
pg_dump -U rails -h localhost -p 5432 <dbname> -f <filename>
psql -U rails -h localhost -d <dbname> -p 5432 -f <filename>
Method 2.
pg_dump -U rails -h localhost -p 5432 <dbname> -F c -f <filename>
pg_restore <filename> -c -U rails -h localhost -p 5432 -d <dbname> -F c -v
<!-- pg_dump -U rails -h localhost -p 5432 moneyonrails -F c -f /mnt/j/系統備份/moneyonrails/"$(date +'%Y%m%d')" -->
